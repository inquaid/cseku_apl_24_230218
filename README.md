# Project: cseku_apl_24_230218

Welcome to the **cseku_apl_24_230218** project! This repository focuses on refactoring source code from previous years, following best practices and modern programming styles that we will explore in this course.

### Description:
The purpose of this repository is to improve code styling and standards, following principles and guidelines covered during the 0714 02 CSE 2100 Advanced Programming Laboratory course.

### README.md


## Task 1: Refactoring Legacy Code

In this task, you will find five source files from previous years' assignments, each named with the suffix `_Old`:

- `BinarySearchTree_Old.cpp`
- `DivisorCount_Old.cpp`
- `DoublyLinkedList_Old.c`
- `MergeSort_Old.cpp`
- `SegmentedSieve_Old.cpp`

### Objective
The main objective is to update these files, applying the coding style and conventions studied in 1st week of the course. The updated files maintains the same functionality but reflect cleaner, more maintainable code. The updated versions of the files have the suffix `_new`:

- `BinarySearchTree_New.cpp`
- `DivisorCount_New.cpp`
- `DoublyLinkedList_New.c`
- `MergeSort_New.cpp`
- `SegmentedSieve_New.cpp`

### Guidelines for Refactoring

....will be updated during the course

### Folder Structure

- **task1/**: Contains the old and updated source files.
- **_old files**: Original code, unchanged from the previous years.
- **_new files**: Updated code with modern styling and improvements.

### Future Tasks

More tasks and challenges will be added as the course progresses.

## Conclusion

This project will help sharpen your coding standards and prepare you for more advanced topics in programming. Keep pushing forward, and remember: Clean code is happy code!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
