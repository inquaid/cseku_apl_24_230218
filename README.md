## Tasks Overview

This repository is organized by tasks, each designed to build programming skills progressively. Each task folder contains source code, documentation, and related resources to complete the assignment.

### Task 1: Refactoring Legacy Code

#### Description
In Task 1, the goal is to refactor legacy code files from previous yearsâ€™ assignments, updating them to align with modern coding standards and best practices. This includes enhancing readability, reducing complexity, and improving maintainability without changing the core functionality.

#### Files

- `BinarySearchTree_Old.cpp`
- `DivisorCount_Old.cpp`
- `DoublyLinkedList_Old.c`
- `MergeSort_Old.cpp`
- `SegmentedSieve_Old.cpp`

#### Objective
Refactor each of these files by applying coding styles and conventions discussed in Week 1 of the course. Each updated file should use a cleaner and more maintainable code structure. Refactored files should have the suffix `_New` to distinguish them from the originals:

- `BinarySearchTree_New.cpp`
- `DivisorCount_New.cpp`
- `DoublyLinkedList_New.c`
- `MergeSort_New.cpp`
- `SegmentedSieve_New.cpp`

#### Refactoring Guidelines
Guidelines for refactoring will be updated as the course progresses, focusing on code readability, organization, and modularity.

### Task 2: My Anime List - SOLID Principles and Object-Oriented Design

#### Description
In Task 2, we delve into Object-Oriented Programming principles, specifically the SOLID principles, by creating a simple anime list manager. This task emphasizes best practices in software architecture and clean code while exploring a real-world application scenario.

#### Project Structure
This task is organized into packages to represent different layers of the application:

- **Model**: Defines core data classes, like `Anime`, with attributes like title, genre, and rating.
- **Repository**: Manages in-memory storage of anime and acts as a centralized data repository.
- **Service**: Contains business logic, including filtering and rating, and implements a `Displayable` interface for flexible display options.
- **UI**: Provides a command-line interface for basic user interactions.

#### Features
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has a single responsibility, adhering to SOLID principles.
- **Dependency Injection**: Allows easy modification and testing of components.
- **Custom Display**: Anime details can be displayed in various formats.
- **Filtering Options**: Users can filter anime by genre, rating, or other customizable criteria.

#### Future Enhancements
This project can be extended to include API integration for live anime data, a graphical user interface, and additional metadata attributes like release year and studio.

## Guidelines for Each Task

- **Coding Standards**: Follow the coding standards discussed in class.
- **Documentation**: Each task should have a README with an overview, objectives, and any specific instructions.
- **Testing**: Whenever possible, include unit tests to validate functionality and ensure robustness.

## Conclusion

This repository is designed to help you strengthen programming foundations, apply best practices, and create well-structured, maintainable code. Each task builds upon the last, guiding you toward becoming a more skilled and thoughtful developer. Remember: clean code is happy code!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
